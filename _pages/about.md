Welcome to my homepage! My name is Yunchao Wang, and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University of Technology. I joined the Data Visualization Group [(ZJUTVIS)](https://zjutvis.org/) at ZJUT in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Ronghua Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fbvnBG4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Guodao Sun](https://godoorsun.org/). My research primarily focuses on visual analytics and human-computer interaction within the realm of natural language processing, utilizing large language models. This includes both interactive text analysis and interactive text generation.    
If you are interested in my work or have any feedback, please feel free to contact me!ðŸŒ¹
