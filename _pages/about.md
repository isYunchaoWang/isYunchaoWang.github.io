Welcome to my homepage! My name is Yunchao Wang, and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University of Technology. I joined the Data Visualization Group [(ZJUTVIS)](https://zjutvis.org/) at ZJUT in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Ronghua Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fbvnBG4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Guodao Sun](https://godoorsun.org/). My research primarily focuses on visual analytics and human-computer interaction within the realm of natural language processing, utilizing large language models. This includes both interactive text analysis and interactive text generation.
