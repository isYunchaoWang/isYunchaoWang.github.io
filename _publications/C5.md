Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields, particularly in natural language understanding and generation tasks. In complex application scenarios, users tend to engage in multi-turn conversations with ChatGPT to keep contextual information and obtain comprehensive responses. However, human forgetting and model contextual forgetting remain prominent issues in multi-turn conversation scenarios, which challenge the usersâ€™ conversation comprehension and contextual continuity for ChatGPT. To address these challenges, we propose an interactive conversation visualization system called C5, which includes Global View, Topic View, and Context-associated Q&A View. The Global View uses the GitLog diagram metaphor to represent the conversation structure, presenting the trend of conversation evolution and supporting the exploration of locally salient features. The Topic View is designed to display all the question and answer nodes and their relationships within a topic using the structure of a knowledge graph, thereby display the relevance and evolution of conversations. The Context-associated Q&A View consists of three linked views, which allow users to explore individual conversations deeply while providing specific contextual information when posing questions. The usefulness and effectiveness of C5 were evaluated through a case study and a user study.
