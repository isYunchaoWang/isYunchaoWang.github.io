Acoustic quality detection is vital in the manufactured products quality control field since it represents the conditions of machines or products. Recent work employed machine learning models in manufactured audio data to detect anomalous patterns. A major challenge is how to select applicable audio features to meliorate modelâ€™s accuracy and precision. To relax this challenge, we extract and analyze three audio feature types including Time Domain Feature, Frequency Domain Feature, and Cepstrum Feature to help identify the potential linear and non-linear relationships. In addition, we design a visual analysis system, namely AFExplorer, to assist data scientists in extracting audio features and selecting potential feature combinations. AFExplorer integrates four main views to present detailed distribution and relevance of the audio features, which helps users observe the impact of features visually in the feature selection. We perform the case study with AFExplore according to the ToyADMOS and MIMII Dataset to demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of the proposed system.
